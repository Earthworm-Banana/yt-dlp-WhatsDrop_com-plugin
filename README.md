### Limitations and Known Issues ❗

- 📉 **Video Quality**: The plugin is set to download the 'streaming' version of the video, which is what you typically watch on the site. A 'high-quality' download option is in the code but has been disabled (commented out) due to functionality issues. For most users, the quality difference is hardly noticeable.

- 🗨️ **Comments**: Downloading of comments is not supported at this time.

- 🌐 **Selenium Requirement**: The feature for downloading publicly viewable liked posts, search results, and popular media requires Selenium due to the necessity of JavaScript for loading the pages.

- ⏳ **Dynamic URLs**: Extracting from large user profiles may result in 404 errors after a few minutes of downloading videos. This is because the site's URLs are slightly dynamic and expire after a certain amount of time. To mitigate this, you can use the `--lazy-playlist` option. Additionally, re-running the extraction will fetch the newer URLs.
