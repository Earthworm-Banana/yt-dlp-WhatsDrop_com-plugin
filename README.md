### Limitations and Known Issues ❗

- 📉 **Video Quality:**
  - **Default Streaming Quality**: Videos are downloaded in the standard 'streaming' quality.
  - **High-Quality Download**: A high-quality download option is coded but inactive due to it retrieving invalid files in trials. Although a visual comparison between both the standard and high-quality from the website (via a typical browser interaction) did not showcase a discernible quality difference, they can occasionally be provided in different media containers (e.g., streaming in .mp4 and download in .mov).

- 🗨️ **Comment Downloading:**
  - Comment downloading is not supported by the plugin.

- 🌐 **Selenium Dependency:**
  - To fully utilize features like downloading publicly viewable liked posts, search results, and popular media which require JavaScript rendering, Selenium is needed.

- ⏳ **Dynamic URL Challenges:**
  - Some URLs may expire during extensive download sessions, potentially causing 404 errors.
  - Workaround: The `--lazy-playlist` option can help navigate this issue, although it may not be as effective if the extractor utilizes Selenium.

- 🚫 **URL Validity Issue:**
  - A rare issue where the plugin might generate invalid URLs has been observed. This was noted in only one specific user account and affected a minimal amount of content (2 out of approximately 280 items).
  - Its impact is minimal, and given its scarcity, it is not an immediate concern but will be monitored and investigated if it emerges as a recurring or impactful problem. Users are encouraged to report such instances.
  - This does not affect the functionality of the plugin, as it only generates invalid URLs that causes a 404 error. Valid URLs are still downloaded.
